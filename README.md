A mobile web app that encourages people to get out there and try new things. 

The user tells the app what they want to do according to various specifications, and using the Groupon and Meetup APIs, the app generates one option and gives the user a response. If the user accepts the “dare” and does the activity, then the app awards them points. 

In future iterations, the user will be able to select more specifications, connect to social media to show points and completed activities to friends, earn a variety of badges and rankings based on unique challenges like volunteering, and more.
