# Going Out App

A web app that encourages people to get out there and try new things. The user tells the app what they want to do according to activity type, rating, area, budget, etc., and using Groupon, and Meetup APIs, the app generates one option and gives the user a response one by one. If the user accepts the “dare” and does the activity, then the app gives them points. The user can earn a variety of badges based on all kinds of fun challenges.
