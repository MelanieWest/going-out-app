MVP Outline:

The user will be prompted to create a profile for the app
Create display with form for email
For password
Once the profile is created, the user can input values into the form
The form will only accept values that make sense. If the values return no options, app will display “no results. Try again.” With a button to fill out the form again.
When the user clicks, the next input form comes up
IF they choose meetup, then they’re asked these inputs:
IF they choose groupOn, then they’re asked these inputs:
Once all inputs have been entered:
The app plugs those inputs in javaScript logic for ajax search
Ajax search will return three randomly selected results (in an Array)
The user gets ONE result, displaying:
Name of result
Link to result page
User can accept or reject the result THREE times
If the user rejects the third result, the app will tell them they have no other options
Once the user accepts an option, the app will say “you’ve selected X” and provide a button to press once the user attends the event
Once the user presses the button, the user is awarded TEN points
Points are stored in user database
Have an option to view profile and to try out a new event
User profile
Total points
Places they’ve attended
